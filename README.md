# ECE-128-Lab-2

Contained in this repository are the files projext_2.v and projext_2tb.v

The first of which contains code that takes advatange of the hardware in the FPGA board in order to create a full-adder system
using the board's switches and LEDs. It does this using Verilog's always/case/endcase statments to code each combination. 

The second file contains code to be run on a Vivado workstation in order to simulate the results of projext_2.v. The simulation will run through every possible combination and use the original code to determine what the outcome on the board should be.
